## Introduction

Object detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and locates objects within images or videos. This project utilizes a pre-trained SSD MobileNet v3 model to detect objects across 80 different classes, as defined in the COCO dataset.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Efficiently detects objects in both images and videos.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Leverages a pre-trained SSD MobileNet v3 model for robust performance.
- **Multiple Classes**: Capable of identifying 80 different object classes.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anmolsinghdz/Object-Detection-Using-MoblieNet-v3-and-SSD.git
